## Subject lines

"Even though Proton Mail subject lines are not end-to end encrypted, it is exceptionally difficult for a third party to get access to them. Access would require breaching Swiss data privacy laws and getting a court order that is approved by a Swiss judge(new window).

You can also use generic subject lines that disclose minimal information about the message contents."
